This repository contains datasets and Jupyter notebooks used in the study “Mechanistic Principles of Antimicrobial Peptides Uncovered by Charge Density Based Machine Learning.”
It includes CSV files containing peptide sequences for both antimicrobial (positive) and non-antimicrobial (negative) datasets. The peptides are categorized into three charge density classes: low, intermediate, and high. Each dataset file provides the peptide sequences used for model training and feature analysis.
The notebooks — Low-charge-density-dataset.ipynb, Intermediate-charge-density-data.ipynb, and High-charge-density-dataset.ipynb — contain all scripts required for data processing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and SHAP-based feature interpretation. 
In these notebooks, peptide sequences are first organized into positive and negative sets according to their charge density values. Physicochemical and sequence-based features are then computed for each peptide. Feature extraction is performed using DSSP and mdtraj (for structural properties from ESMFold-predicted structures), and PyBioMed, peptides, and RDKit (for physicochemical and molecular descriptors). All these packages are freely available. Three separate machine learning models are trained — one for each charge density group — to classify antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial peptides. Model performance is evaluated, and mean SHAP value analysis is performed to identify the most influential physicochemical features that drive the model’s predictions.
This structure allows each notebook to independently handle dataset preparation, feature extraction, model development, and interpretation for its respective charge density class.
Additional CD-HIT notebooks (CD-HIT-LD.ipynb, CD-HIT-ID.ipynb, CD-HIT-HD.ipynb) generate non-redundant datasets for each charge class by removing highly similar sequences before feature extraction and model development.
Three notebooks — low-top-features.ipynb, intermediate-top-features.ipynb, and high-top-features.ipynb — train models using only the top 3 and top 5 most important descriptors, allowing evaluation of how reduced feature sets impact predictive performance across charge-density regimes.
Finally, the external-validation.ipynb notebook tests the trained models on an unseen peptide dataset to assess generalization and confirm that the learned physicochemical signatures remain predictive beyond the training sets.
